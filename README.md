# Bootcamp Midterm Project

In this project, I replicated a Figma design in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in a fully responsive way.

## Basic functionalities

### Pages

* **Home page: `/` or `/homepage.html`**

* **Project page: `/projects.html?id=<project-id>`**

* **Contact page: `/contact-us.html`**

### Obtaining project data from the API

Project data is obtained from [the endpoint provided in the instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironhack-jc/mid-term-api/main/projects), both in project lists and in individual project pages.

### Contact form validation

Form validation conditions are defined in the file [`scripts/form-conditions.js`](scripts/form-conditions.js) and executed in [`scripts/form-validation.js`](scripts/form -validation.js).
